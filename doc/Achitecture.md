# A Reactive Architecture for ECS: Reconciling Performance and Modularity

---

## Introduction

Game engine development is often perceived as an expert-only domain. Yet, beneath every performant engine lies a single unifying force: **software architecture**.

A poor architecture inevitably leads to technical debt. A good one ensures **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability** over time. Among the leading paradigms, the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** stands out for its data-oriented design. However, ECS comes with its own set of trade-offs — especially regarding communication between systems and runtime flexibility.

This article introduces **Reactive ECS (RECS)** — a hybrid architecture that combines the performance of ECS with the **reactivity and decoupling** of event-driven models. RECS aims to preserve ECS’s cache efficiency while offering a more declarative and composable system pipeline.

## What is ECS?

The **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** is an architecture where game objects are represented by **entities**, uniquely identified. These entities are **structural only**: they have no behavior or logic.

Game logic is handled by **systems**, which operate on **components** attached to entities. Each system processes only the entities possessing a specific set of components.

Modern ECS frameworks often rely on the notion of **archetypes**: groupings of entities sharing the same component combination, allowing for optimized batch processing.

---

### Bitset Representation

A classical approach involves representing archetypes using bitsets. This allows for fast checks using bitwise operations:

```julia
archetype = 0b0011  # The entity has components 1 and 2
physic    = 0b0010  # The "Physic" system requires only component 2

if (archetype & physic == physic)
    # The entity is compatible with the Physic system
end
```

This method is performant but less scalable at large scale (binary limits, complex management). One can also use **dynamic queries**, but their cost is non-negligible.

---

## What is RECS?

**Reactive ECS (RECS)** is a high-performance ECS framework built in Julia, designed to combine the efficiency of data-oriented design with the flexibility of reactive programming. At its core, RECS uses a centralized **ECSManager** that stores entities in a **Struct of Arrays (SoA)** layout in a columnar way (entities are rows, components are columns), represent archetypes with **partitions**, use query to get the relevant partitions and dispatches them to subscribed systems.

### Core Principles
- **Structured Storage**: Entities are stored in a partitioned cache-friendly SoA layout.
- **Targeted Dispatch**: Systems receive only the data they need, minimizing overhead.
- **Reactive Processing**: Systems communicate via data pipelines, using `listen_to` for loose coupling.
- **Entity Pooling**: Reuses memory slots for fast entity creation/deletion.

### Key Features
- **Cache-efficient SoA**: Optimizes memory access for large-scale processing.
- **Dynamic Subscriptions**: Systems subscribe to a query, which may change at runtime.
- **Reactive Pipelines**: Systems can listen to others’ outputs, enabling flexible workflows.
- **Low Allocations**: Minimal memory overhead during dispatch and execution.
- **Runtime Extensibility**: Add, modify, or remove systems without code changes.
- **Advanced Event System**: Built on [Notifyers.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Notifyers.jl), supporting merge, filtering, one-shot listeners, priorities, and more.
- **Profiling Tools**: Built-in debugging and visualization for performance analysis.

### Example in Julia

```julia
using ReactiveECS

# This will create a new component
# And set boilerplates for us
@component Health begin
    hp::Int
end

@component Transform begin
    x::Float32
    y::Float32
end

@component Physic begin
    velocity::Float32
end

@system PhysicSystem begin
    delta::Float32
end
@system RenderSystem

function ReactiveECS.run!(world, sys::Physic, ref::WeakRef)
    query = ref.value
    transforms = get_component(world, :Transforms)  # Get all Position components
    physics = get_component(world, :Physic)
    x_pos = transforms.x
    velocities = physics.velocity

    dt = sys.dt

    @foreachrange query begin
        for idx in range
            x_pos[idx] += velocities[idx]*dt  # Move entity along x-axis
        end
    end
    return transforms  # Pass data to listeners
end

function ReactiveECS.run!(world, ::RenderSystem, pos)
    for i in eachindex(pos)
        t = pos[i]
        println("Rendering entity at position ($(t.x), $(t.y))")
    end
end


# Setup
world = ECSManager()
physic_sys = PhysicSystem()
render_sys = RenderSystem()

# This entity will have e1 as parent
e2 = create_entity!(world; Health = Health(50), Transform = Transform(-5.0,0.0), Physic = Physic(1.0))
e3 = create_entity!(world; Health = Health(50), Transform = Transform(-5.0,0.0), Physic = Physic(1.0))

subscribe!(world, physic_sys, @query(world, Transform & Physic))
listen_to(physic_sys, render_sys)

run_system!(physic_sys)
run_system!(render_sys)

N = 3

for i in 1:N
    println("FRAME $i")

    # We dispatch data and each system will execute his `run!` function
    dispatch_data(world)
    blocker(world) # Will make the process wait for all systems to finish
    yield()
    sleep(0.016)
end
```

> **Note** : the function `listen_to` just add the system as a listener, the 2 systems don't need each other. the listener (the last argument of the function) simply wait passively for data which can come from anyone, and the source just pass the results of his `run!` function to every system listening to him.

### Technical Overview

#### **Internal Storage**

Components are stored in a partitioned **Struct of Arrays (SoA)** layout. When a new component is added, its SoA resizes to match the size of others, ensuring consistent index mapping. This is usually done at the component creation with `register_component!(world, type)`. When an entity is added, It's added to a partition representing its archetype, and the index in that partition becomes the entity ID. Upon removal, the entity is swapped with the last entity of the partition and the partition shrink.

Unused slots remain undefined but reserved — enabling **fast pooling** and simple memory reuse.

```

* Rows 1–4: partition for entities with `Health` and `Transform`

  * Rows 1–2 are **active**, 3–4 are **pooled**
* Rows 5–6: partition for entities with `Health`, `Transform`, and `Physic`

### Tree Layout

The hierarchy between entities is ensured via the package [NodeTree](https://github.com/Gesee-y/NodeTree.jl), adding support for BFS/DFS and other traversal utility using `RECS.BFS_search(ecs)` or `RECS.DFS_search(ecs)`
We can visualize that hierarchy with `print_tree(io, ecs)`

#### Example layout
```
ECSManager with 4 Nodes : 
    ├─Entity : "Entity 1"
    ├─Entity : "Entity 2"
    │   └─Entity : "Entity 3"
    └─Entity : "Entity 4"
```

### Dispatching Logic

The `ECSManager` acts as the central coordinator. It holds all components using a **Struct of Arrays (SoA)** layout for cache-friendly access patterns. When `dispatch_data` is called, the manager sends each subscribed system a **`Query`**.

A  `Query` is a struct containing the matching partitions for that system. Each partition contain the range of the matching entities and these range can easily be accessed with `@foreachrange`

This design eliminates the need for explicitly optional components — systems technically have access to all registered components due to the sparse nature of the data's storage — but only the relevant subset is prefiltered and passed to them for iteration.

### Subscription Logic

When a system subscribes to a query, the manager object just add it to the list of system with his query (like a new element in a dictionnary).

The `subscribe!` function has a time complexity of **`O(1)`**, since it's just as simple as adding an element to a dict.
Note that this means the manager doesn't keep track of system types but of systems instances. So multiple instance of the same system can coexist with different queries.

### System Execution

Calling `run_system!` starts the system in a blocking task, which suspends execution until the `ECSManager` dispatches the required data. Once unblocked, the system's `run!` function is invoked with its input data. Upon completion, the result is automatically forwarded to all systems registered as listeners via `listen_to`.

To prevent runtime issues, **cyclic dependencies between systems are detected recursively** during `listen_to` registration, and a warning is emitted if a cycle is found.

Then, the system listening to another one will be executed as asynchronous task so there is no enforced execution order. Instead, systems can be chained via listener relationships.

If a system encounters an error during execution, it will raise a warning that can be logged and the system's execution will be stopped. A crashed system can be restarted by simply calling `run_system!` again.

### Race Condition

To prevent race conditions during systems's executions, we provide `HierarchicalLock` which is a tree of lock where each field (and nested sub fields) of a component possess a lock.
For example if we have system A, system B, system C running in parallel and a component Transform. System A want to write on the x field of transform, B on the y field and C want to read both and eventually write. Instead of putting a lock on transform (which may also block system B), system A will just lock the x field which he his using while System B will lock the y field.
This allow granular control over parallelism while introducing a low overhead (400ns for the lifecycle of a lock.).

### Event system

ReactiveECS provide a fully functional event system. It leverage the [Notifyers.jl](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Notifyers.jl) package.
You can define a new package with `@Notifyer(arg1::T1, arg2::T2, ..., argn::Tn)`, see [Notifyers's doc](https://github.com/Gesee-y/Notifyers.jl/blob/main/docs/index.md). You can reuse all the features available in that package here. Meaning supports for:
- **Merge**: Combine multiple events (e.g., 10 HP changes into 1).
- **Filtering**: Calls listener just if the event meet some conditions.
- **One-shot Listeners**: Execute once and unsubscribe.
- **Priorities and Delays**: Control execution order and timing.
- **Retention**: Store recent event values.
- **Performance**: 200 ns (no listeners), 1.6 µs (per listener), 4 µs (in single task state, independent from the listeners's count).

### Debugging and profiling

We can switch to debug mode by overloading the function `debug_mode()`.
On this mode, the manager object will log the data received by each system, the data returned and profiling will be active
We can get the statistics of a system with `get_profile_stats(system)`. The format of the stats is the same as the one returned by `@timed`.
By default, the logs aren't directly written to a file. You should use `write!(io, ecs.logger)` where `ecs` is your `ECSManager` object.

### Dispatch Overhead

| Number of Systems  | Performance           |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2                  |  ~580 ns (0 alloc)    |
| 5                  |  ~1.3 μs (0 alloc)    |

| 20                 |  ~5.3 μs (0 alloc)    |
| 50                 |  ~13.5 μs (0 alloc) |
| 100                |  ~26.1 μs (0 alloc) |
| 200                |  ~50.3 μs (0 alloc) |

> **Complexity**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of system subscriptions.
> **Note**: This system synchronization introduce a constant overhead of 10-15 μs

### Entity operations

* **Adding entity** : 1.21 μs (8 allocations: 896 bytes)
* **Removing entity** : 861 ns (1 allocations: 90 bytes)

> **Analysis**:
>
> * Adding an entity requires just adding the entity components to the matching partitions, so it's `O(c)` where `c` is the number of components the entity have.
> * Removing is just swapping the entity with the last valid one and then decrementing the range. It's `O(c)` where `c` is the number of component of the entity to remove.

## Advantages of RECS

- **High Performance**: Cache efficency, vectorized updates, etc.
- **Improved memory locality**: components stored in contiguous SoA layout with partitions to ensure data alignment.
- **Stable performance**: one dispatch per tick, no redundant queries.
- **Reactive Design**: `listen_to` enables decoupled, dynamic system pipelines.
- **Flexible Events**: Merge, one-shot, and prioritized events enhance reactivity.
- **Scalability**: Efficient for 100k+ entities, with pooling and SoA.
- **Extensibility**: Add systems at runtime with minimal code changes.
- **Profiling**: Built-in tools for debugging and optimization.
- **Ready for distributed architecture**: ECSManager can be centralized for multiplayer or server-client architectures.

## Actual limitation

- **Synchronization overhead**: There are some 10-50 μs due to synchronizing systems paid per frame
