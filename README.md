# Reactive ECS in Julia

A high-performance, modular, event-driven ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture written in Julia. Designed for game engines, simulations, or any data-oriented architecture requiring reactive system dispatching and efficient memory layout.

> The term 'Reactive' refers to the fact that systems react to the presence of data to run their process

---

## Features

- **Data-oriented ECS** with columnar data storage, entities as row, components as columns.
- **Reactive dispatch system**: systems only receive relevant entities each frame.
- **Chunk-based memory layout** for cache efficiency and performance.
- **Multithreading-ready**: systems can process chunks in parallel.
- **Dynamic system subscription** at runtime.
- **Server-ready architecture**: centralized dispatch can scale across networked clients.
- **Benchmark proven** with consistent performance across large entity counts.

## Installation

```julia
julia> ]add ReactiveECS
```

For development version

```julia
julia> ] add https://github.com/Gesee-y/ReactiveECS.jl
````

## Architecture Overview

* `Entity`: an ID with a map of named components.
* `Component`: any struct implementing `AbstractComponent`.
* `System`: a process that subscribes to an archetype and operates on matching entities.
* `ECSManager`: the central controller that stores entities, handles subscriptions, and dispatches entity batches to systems.
* `Partitions`: Range of entity with the same components combination.
